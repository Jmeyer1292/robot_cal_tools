/*
 * Computes the pose of a "target" seen in one or more intrinsically and extrinsically calibrated

 * at the target must be specified in this same base frame. The answer will also be in this common
 * base frame.
 *
 * Note that this function is logically equivalent to the solver available in pnp.h assuming that
 * you specified ONE camera with an identity transform.

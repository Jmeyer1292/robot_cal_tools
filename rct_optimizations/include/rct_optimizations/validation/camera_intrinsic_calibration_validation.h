 *         - Correspondences are ordered in the same way for each observation
 *         - The correspondences in each observation can be divided in half to get the same two sets of features
 *     2. Calculate error between two virtual correspondence sets in adjacent observations
 *     3. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the positional difference in this error for all observations

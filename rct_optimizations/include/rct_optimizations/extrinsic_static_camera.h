/*
 * This file defines a solver for calibrating the EXTRINSIC parameters of a pinhole
 * camera in a static position to the base of a robot. It works by imaging a target
 * fixed to the robot's wrist from many robot poses.
 *
 * This calibration works on undistorted or rectified images!
 *
 * This calibration uses the following "frames":
 * 1. A "base frame" in which the robot's wrist positions and the camera frame are reported
 *    in. It should be static with respect to the camera. This will commonly be the robot
 *    "base_link" or your workcell's "world" frame.
 * 2. A "wrist frame" to which your target is rigidly attached. You must give this frame's
 *    position with respect to the above "base frame" at every image location. This will
 *    commonly be "tool0" or some fixed offset from the robot's flange.
 * 3. A "target frame" which is represented as the origin of your rigid 3D pattern. It is
 *    rigidly attached to the robot's wrist frame. It is in this frame that the 3D entries of
 *    ObservationSet are given. For the circle grid target, this is the big dot, with +X going
 *    left to right across the bottom row and +Y going up the first column.
 * 4. The "camera frame" or "camera optical frame". This frame is solved for and should be fixed
 *    with respect to the "base frame". Uses the OpenCV model for camera coordinates.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *  - Camera intrisic parameters (fx, fy, cx, cy)
 *  - A sequence of transformations: "base frame" to "wrist frame" for each image position
 *  - A sequence of correspondence sets for each image position
 *  - Each correspondence set is a set of correspondences: a position in the "target frame" (3D)
 *    and where that point was seen in the image (2D).
 *  - You must also provide a guess for the two transforms being calibrated.
 *
 * Output:
 *  - The best-fit transform from robot "base frame" to the "camera optical frame"
 *  - The best-fit transform from "wrist frame" to the "target frame"
 *  - A final cost per observation representing the average reprojection error, in pixels,
 *    along the u or v image axis.
 *
 * To use: Fill out ExtrinsicStaticCameraMovingTargetProblem then call optimize()

/***
 * This file contains a standalone example of performing a calibration to understand the transform

 *  1. The camera intrinsics
 *  2. The target size and spacing
 *  3. A bunch of pictures of the target, and
 *  4. The position of the robot wrist (in its base frame) when each of the pictures was taken
 *
 * This is only supposed to be a sample to ease understanding. See the equivalent tool for a
 * configurable offline processor of your data

  // The general goal is to fill out the 'Extrinsic Camera on Wrist' problem definition
  // and then call 'rct_optimizations::optimize()' on it.

  // Step 1: Create a problem definition. It requires we set:
  // - Camera Intrinsics
  // - Guesses for the 'base to target' and 'wrist to camera'
  // - The wrist poses
  // - Correspondences (2D in image to 3D in target) for each wrist pose
  rct_optimizations::ExtrinsicCameraOnWristProblem problem_def;

  // Step 1: Define the camera intrinsics - I know mine so I write them here. If you don't know
  // yours, use the opencv calibration tool to figure them out!

  problem_def.intr.fy() = 510.0;
  problem_def.intr.cx() = 320.2;
  problem_def.intr.cy() = 208.9;

  // Step 2: Let's add the guesses next. See the rct_examples/README.md for a discussion about the
  // reference frames for the camera and target!

                         0, 0, 1;

  problem_def.wrist_to_camera_guess.linear() = wrist_to_camera_rot;

  problem_def.base_to_target_guess.translation() = base_to_target_tx;
  problem_def.base_to_target_guess.linear() = base_to_target_rot;

  // Step 3: We need to specify the wrist-poses and the correspondences. I'm going to use a simple
  // tool I wrote to load images and wrist poses from a file. You need to implement the data
  // collection logic for your application.

  // Step 3.1: Load the data set (and make sure it worked)
  const std::string data_path = ros::package::getPath("rct_examples") + "/data/test_set_10x10/cal_data.yaml";
  boost::optional<rct_ros_tools::ExtrinsicDataSet> maybe_data_set = rct_ros_tools::parseFromFile(data_path);
  // Attempt to load the data set via the data record yaml file:
  if (!maybe_data_set)
  {
    std::cerr << "Failed to parse data set from path = " << data_path << "\n";
    return 1;
  }
  // Now that its loaded let's create some aliases to make this nicer
  const std::vector<cv::Mat>& image_set = maybe_data_set->images;
  const std::vector<Eigen::Isometry3d>& wrist_poses = maybe_data_set->tool_poses;

  // Step 3.2: We need to conver the images of calibration targets into sets of correspondences.
  // In our case, each dot on the target becomes a correspondence: A pair of positions, one for
  // where the dot was seen in the image (u, v in pixels) and one for where that same dot is in the
  // target (x,y,z in meters). Repeat for each image.

  // The 'rct_image_tools' package provides a class for describing the target (it's 3D points) and
  // a class for finding that target in an image. So let's create a target...
  rct_image_tools::ModifiedCircleGridTarget target(10, 10, 0.0254); // rows, cols, spacing between dots

  // The Observation Finder class uses the target definition to search images
  rct_image_tools::ModifiedCircleGridObservationFinder obs_finder(target);

  // Now we'll loop over the images and 1) find the dots, 2) pair them with the target location,
  // and 3) push them into the problem definition.
  // This process of finding the dots can fail, we we make sure they are found before adding the
  // wrist location for that image.
  for (std::size_t i = 0; i < image_set.size(); ++i)
  {
    // Try to find the circle grid in this image:
    boost::optional<std::vector<Eigen::Vector2d>> maybe_obs = obs_finder.findObservations(image_set[i]);
    if (!maybe_obs)
    {
      std::cerr << "Unable to find the circle grid in image: " << i << "\n";
      continue;
    }

    // We found the target! Let's "zip-up" the correspondence pairs for this image - one for each
    // dot. So we create a data structure:
    rct_optimizations::CorrespondenceSet correspondences;

    // And loop over each detected dot:
    for (std::size_t j = 0; j < maybe_obs->size(); ++j)
    {
      // The 'target.points' data structure and the observation vector returned by
      // 'obs_finder.findObservations()' are in the same order! So the j-th index in each
      // respresents the same dot!
      rct_optimizations::Correspondence2D3D pair;
      pair.in_image = maybe_obs->at(j); // The obs finder and target define their points in the same order!
      pair.in_target = target.points[j];
      correspondences.push_back(pair);
    }

    // Finally, let's add the wrist pose for this image, and all of the images correspondences
    // to the problem!
    problem_def.wrist_poses.push_back(wrist_poses[i]);
    problem_def.image_observations.push_back(correspondences);
  }

  // Step 4: You defined a problem, let the tools solve it! Call 'optimize()'.
  rct_optimizations::ExtrinsicCameraOnWristResult opt_result = rct_optimizations::optimize(problem_def);

  // Step 5: Do something with your results. Here I just print the results, but you might want to
  // update a data structure, save to a file, push to a mutable joint or mutable state publisher in
  // ROS. The options are many, and it's up to you. We just try to help solve the problem.
